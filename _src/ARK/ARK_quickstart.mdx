## Update your glasses

You'll need to update your Aria glasses using the Mobile companion app before you can use them.

### Install the Mobile companion app

1. On your Android phone, go to [portal.projectaria.com](http://portal.projectaria.com/)
2. Select the menu bar on the top right of the screen to sign into your account
3. Scroll down to Aria for Android
    * You'll only be able to see the Android app link if you are browsing from an Android device
1. Select Aria for Android and the app will start downloading

If your phone only accepts 32-bit apps, please reach out to [AriaOps@meta.com](mailto:AriaOps@meta.com) for the 32-bit .apk.

### Pair your glasses

1. Plug your glasses into power using the provided cable.
2. Sign into the app using your provided user name and password
3. Follow the prompts to pair your glasses
    * Your glasses are automatically updated when you first pair them
    * Go to the [Mobile app page](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app.mdx) for further information

Further updates will be queued automatically when you use your glasses via the Mobile Companion App. If you need to manually check for updates, select the gear icon (settings) next to your glasses and then select Check for OS Updates.

## Set your Default Recording Profile

You can set the default recording profile via Mobile or Desktop Companion App. This is the recording profile used when you initiate recording via the capture button or Desktop app.

 When you select New Recording in the Mobile Companion app you'll intially see the default recording profile. Select the recording profile to view sensor settings or to select a different recording profile.

In the Mobile Companion App, you can change the Default Recording Profile at any time via Device Settings (select the settings/gear icon next to your glasses on the dashboard).

## Install the Desktop app (Optional)

The Desktop app is required for requesting Machine Perception Services and streaming data, but you don't need the Desktop app to make recordings or download data. You can also visualize data in the Desktop app. Go to the [Desktop app page](desktop_companion_app.mdx) for more detailed instructions.

1. Go to [portal.projectaria.com](http://portal.projectaria.com/)
2. Select the menu bar on the top right of the screen to sign into your account
3. Scroll down to Aria for Desktop
    * It will display for MacOS, Windows or Linux, depending on what sort of operating system you're running
4. Select Aria for Mac/Windows to download and install
5. Use the username and password provided in your welcome email to sign into the app.

## Record Data

It's best to initiate recording using the Mobile Companion app or by pressing the Capture button.

Make sure you don't use the Privacy Switch to finish a recording, as this will delete your data.

:::info
The longer your glasses record for, the longer it takes a recording to stop. This is because the larger the VRS file, the more time it takes for a recording to finish indexing. The recording has not fully stopped until the Recording LEDs have turned off.
:::

### Press the Capture button

The capture button is located on the top right of your glasses. The capture button will use the default recording profile.

Once you've pressed the capture button, please allow a few seconds before the recording starts. You'll know recording has started when the Recording LEDs turn on.

Press the same button to stop and save the recording.


:::tip
Engaging the privacy switch will stop the recording and discard your recording. Discarded recordings cannot be retrieved.
:::

### Mobile Companion app

* Select New Recording Session in the Aria Dashboard to start recording.
    * Go to the [Mobile Companion App page](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app.mdx) for more information

You can alter the Name and Notes of a recording by going to the Recordings menu, selecting a recording and then selecting **Edit**.


## Download data

Aria recordings are stored as a VRS file and an accompanying JSON file that includes the recording's metadata. Metadata includes:

* The name and description of the recording as shown in the Mobile Companion App
* The recording profile used
* What version of the Mobile Companion App was used to create the recording

Aria recordings are directly accessible from the glasses' SDCARD. There are three ways you can download data to your local machine using:

* MTP
* ADB commands
* Aria Desktop Companion App

We recommend using MTP or ADB commands for a faster download experience.


### Use MTP via File Explorer

#### Windows

When you plug in your Aria glasses to your computer, you can navigate to it as if it were any other USB external storage device.

1. Plug your Aria glasses into your computer, using the supplied cable
    * Please allow a few minutes for your glasses to be detected
2. Your glasses will appear in your directory as an external drive called “Aria”
3. Select Aria and then go to Internal Storage > recording
4. In this folder you will see the .vrs file and .json file that stores the .vrs files' metadata
    * You'll also see a thumbnails folder, which contains the thumbnails that are used to provide previews of your content in the Mobile app
5. Copy the data to local storage

#### MacOS

MTP is not provided natively on MacOS, but there are lightweight tools that you can use, such as [Android File Transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/).

1. Download and install Android File Transfer https://www.android.com/filetransfer/
2. Connect your Aria glasses to your computer
3. Drag & drop files


### Use ADB

[Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) (adb) is a command line tool that can be used with Aria glasses.

To download all your data:
```cpp
adb pull /sdcard/recording /home/unixname/MyVRSFolder
```

To download a single VRS file
```cpp
adb pull /sdcard/recording/myVrsFile.vrs /home/unixname/MyVRSFolder/
```

To download a single metadata file
```cpp
adb pull /sdcard/recording/myVrsFile.json /home/unixname/MyVRSFolder/
```

### Use the Desktop App

Go to the Recordings section in the Desktop app to download your data. See the [Desktop App page](/docs/ARK/desktop_companion_app.mdx) for further information.


## Streaming

Using the Desktop app, Aria Sensor data can be live streamed via Wi-Fi. We recommend only using Profiles 12 and 18, which are optimized for streaming.

Go to the [Desktop app page](/docs/ARK/desktop_companion_app.mdx#streaming) for detailed instructions.
