# Aria Research Kit

The Aria Research Kit (ARK) provides Aria glasses, services and tools to enable researchers to gather and process their own Aria data. Go to [Aria Research Kit intro page](https://www.projectaria.com/research-kit/) to find out more or to apply for the ARK.

The instructions in this section will only be useful if you have access to the ARK.


import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/ARK/metaverse.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/ARK/metaverse_dark.jpg'),
  }}
/>


## Hardware Requirements

To be able to use Aria glasses you will need to use the Mobile Companion app

* Mobile Companion App:
    * Android device - 64-bit is preferred, although 32-bit is supported
    * Android OS version 10 or above installed
    * ARM64 processor preferred
    * ARCore Depth API (https://developers.google.com/ar/devices) support needed for eye-tracking calibration


To be able to request Machine Perception Services or stream data, you will need to use the Desktop app.

* Desktop App runs on the following platforms:
    * MacOS Big Sur 11.3+, both Intel and Apple Silicon
    * Windows 10 x86_64 with DirectX (or OpenGL but the latest drivers should be installed)
    * Windows 11 may work, but is not actively supported at this time
    * Linux, as a debian package for Ubuntu, 22.04 LTS version. The app was only tested for that specific version under Gnome 42.5 and X11 (X Server) as well as Wayland. Any other debian distribution (Ubuntu 22.04 fork such as Kubuntu, Mint etc.) or environment may or may not work.
