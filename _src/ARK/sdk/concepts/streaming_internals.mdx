# Streaming Internals

## Overview
In the future, this page will provide deeper dives into how data is streamed. For now, here are a few points!


## Wi-Fi vs USB Streaming

Lag (or perceptions of lag) can be caused by a number of factors. USB streaming provides higher throughput and lower latency compared to streaming over Wi-Fi.


## Real Time Publish-Subscribe Data Distribution Service

We use the [eProsima implementation of Fast DDS](https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/) as the Real Time Publish-Subscribe Data Distribution Service.


## Streaming Security

This section will contain details about streaming certificates used (these are not the same as the authorization certificates stored in the Mobile Companion app).
