- Pair the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
- Connect to the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
- Control Aria recording capabilities
- Control Aria streaming capabilities

## Help

```
aria --help
```

will show you all the available options

## Connecting

Connecting to the device is done in two ways:

- Wi-Fi: you will need to specify the `--device-ip` option

- USB: you do not need to manually input the device IP when the device is plugged in via USB. The CLI will automatically connect to the device. Use the `--serial` option if more than one device is plugged in via USB.

### Retrieve device IP

If you wish to manually input a device IP via the --device-ip option, you first need to pair your Aria device with the Companion App, connect your glasses to a Wi-Fi network and use the Companion App to retrieve the device IP:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img width="50%" height="50%" src={useBaseUrl('img/ARK/sdk/companionAppDeviceIp.jpg')} alt="Companion App WiFi Settings"/>
</div>
