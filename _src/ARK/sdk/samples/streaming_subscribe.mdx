# Subscribe to and Display Aria Streaming Data

## Overview
This page shows how to use the code sample `streaming_subscribe` to subscribe to a Project Aria glasses datastream. It also provides a code walkthrough of `streaming_subscribe`'s capabilities.

`streaming_subscribe` enables you to:
* Subscribe to a streaming session initiated by device_stream or the CLI and access sensor data through its observer
* Visualize the live stream
* Unsubscribe from a streaming session

If you're on MacOS and lose internet connection, run `aria-doctor` in a separate terminal.

## Stream and subscribe examples

### Example 1: Stream and subscribe over USB
In this example you will:
* Start streaming using the CLI
* Subscribe to the live stream using the SDK
* Show a live preview of the sensor data from Aria's RGB and Mono Scene (SLAM) cameras


1. Plug your Aria glasses into your computer, using the provided cable
2. In Terminal, go to the samples directory and run:

```bash
aria streaming start --interface usb --use-ephemeral-certs
```

3. Wait for the stream to start then run:

```bash
python -m streaming_subscribe
```

You should then see:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/ARK/sdk/streaming_subscribe.png')} alt="Aria Live Stream Window"/>
</div>

4. There are several ways you can stop streaming:
  * Press q or ESC to quit the app
  * Use Ctrl-C to terminate in terminal
  * Press the Capture button on your glasses

### Example 2: Using Wi-Fi

To use Wi-Fi to initiate streaming or to stream data, alter the `aria streaming start --interface usb --use-ephemeral-certs` command.

* To stream data over Wi-Fi, use `--interface wifi`
* To initiate streaming over Wi-Fi, add `--device-ip <glasses IP>`
  * To get your glasses' IP address, open the Mobile Companion app and tap Wi-Fi

## Code walkthrough

Ensure that Aria CLI is started using the `--use-ephemeral-certs` flag to use ephemeral certificates to stream data securely. Go to [Streaming Internals](/docs/ARK/sdk/concepts/streaming_internals) to find out more about streaming certificates (which are not the same as the authorization certificate in the Mobile Companion app).

This code snippet assumes basic familiarity with OpenCV for image rendering and interaction.

### 1. Instantiate Streaming Client

An instance of `StreamingClient` is created to manage streaming data.

```python
streaming_client = aria.StreamingClient()
```
### 2. Configure the subscription
  - Subscription is configured to listen to Aria's RGB and SLAM streams. The `subscriber_data_type` attribute determines the type of data the client subscribes to.

```python
config = streaming_client.subscription_config
config.subscriber_data_type = (
    aria.StreamingDataType.Rgb | aria.StreamingDataType.Slam
)
```

### 3. Set message queue size
  - The message queue size determines how many recent frames will be retained. A smaller queue size is utilized to process only the most recent data.

```python
config.message_queue_size[aria.StreamingDataType.Rgb] = 1
config.message_queue_size[aria.StreamingDataType.Slam] = 1
```

### 4. Set streaming security options
  - Security options are set to use ephemeral certificates through a `StreamingSecurityOptions` instance. Go to [the Streaming Internals page](/docs/ARK/sdk/concepts/streaming_internals) for various aspects of streaming security and how certificates are used.

```python
options = aria.StreamingSecurityOptions()
options.use_ephemeral_certs = True
config.security_options = options
```
### 5. Create an StreamingClient observer and attach it
   - An observer class `StreamingClientObserver` is defined and instantiated. It manages the received image data. The method `on_image_received` is a callback that allows you to store images with their corresponding camera ID.

```python
class StreamingClientObserver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.images = {}

    def on_image_received(self, image: np.array, record: ImageDataRecord):
        self.images[record.camera_id] = image

observer = StreamingClientObserver()
streaming_client.set_streaming_client_observer(observer)
```

### 6. Start subscribing and listen to the live stream
   - The client begins listening for incoming streaming data from the subscribed data types.

```python
streaming_client.subscribe()
```

### 6. Visualize the live stream
  - RGB and SLAM images are visualized in separate windows using OpenCV. The images are processed and displayed the streaming stops or the application quit. We rotate the image and stack the SLAM images so that they are shown in a single window.


```python
while not quit_keypress():
    # Render the RGB image
    if aria.CameraId.Rgb in observer.images:
        rgb_image = np.rot90(observer.images[aria.CameraId.Rgb], -1)
        rgb_image = cv2.cvtColor(rgb_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        cv2.imshow(rgb_window, rgb_image)
        del observer.images[aria.CameraId.Rgb]

    # Stack and display the SLAM images
    if (
        aria.CameraId.Slam1 in observer.images
        and aria.CameraId.Slam2 in observer.images
    ):
        slam1_image = np.rot90(observer.images[aria.CameraId.Slam1], -1)
        slam2_image = np.rot90(observer.images[aria.CameraId.Slam2], -1)
        cv2.imshow(slam_window, np.hstack((slam1_image, slam2_image)))
        del observer.images[aria.CameraId.Slam1]
        del observer.images[aria.CameraId.Slam2]
```


:::note
Cameras on Aria glasses are installed sideways. The visualizer rotates the raw image data for a more natural view.

### 7. Unsubscribe from the stream and free resources
   - Unsubscribing stops the client from listening to streaming data and cleans up resources.

```python
streaming_client.unsubscribe()
```
