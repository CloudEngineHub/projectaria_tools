## How to Stream Data Using the Project Aria Client SDK

This page shows how to run the code sample `device_stream` to stream data from Project Aria sensors and provides a code walkthrough of its capabilities.

`device_stream` enables you to:
    * Set how the sensors will stream data using [recording profiles](/docs/tech_spec/recording_profiles)
    * Access sensor calibration through the streaming manager.
    * Start and stop streaming data from Aria glasses over USB
    * Start and stop streaming data from Aria glasses over Wi-FI
    * Visualize the sensor streams
      * Use [`device_subscribe`](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/streaming_subscribe) to access the data
    * Display undistorted RGB live stream

If you're on MacOS and lose internet connection, run `aria-doctor` in a separate terminal.

:::note
This code sample requires Python 3.9+ because of a fastplotlib dependency
:::

## Run `device_stream`
:::info
You can skip `--update_iptables` for all streaming sample apps on MacOS
:::

### Example 1: Start and stop streaming over USB

In this example you'll use the SDK to:
* Connect to the device via USB
* Start streaming over USB
* Show a live preview of the sensor data from Aria's RGB, SLAM, ET cameras as well as IMU sensors.


1. Plug your Aria glasses into your computer, using the provided cable
2. In terminal, go to the samples directory and run:

```bash
python -m device_stream --interface usb --update_iptables
```

You should then see:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img width="100%" height="100%" src={useBaseUrl('img/ARK/sdk/device_stream.png')} alt="Aria Live Stream Window"/>
</div>

:::note
Cameras on Aria glasses are installed sideways. By default, images are reported and viewed as they were provided by cameras and will appear sideways.
:::


3. There are several ways you can stop streaming:
  * Press q or ESC to quit the app
  * Use Ctrl-C to terminate in terminal
  * Press the Capture button on your glasses


### Example 2: Start and stop streaming over Wi-Fi
Streaming over Wi-Fi is similar, with a few extra steps.

1. Connect your Aria Glasses and Computer to the same Wi-Fi compatible Wi-Fi network:
  * Check [Requirements](/docs/ARK/sdk/setup.mdx) for details about compatible routers
2. Find the IP address of your glasses in the Companion App under `Wi-Fi` status
3. In terminal, go to the samples directory and run:

```bash
python device_stream --interface wifi --ip-address <Glasses IP> --update_iptables
```

4. Stop streaming using any of the methods listed in Example 1

### Example 3: Display undistorted RGB live stream over USB

To display undistorted RGB live stream over USB, follow the steps in Example 1, but run a different command from the samples directory.

```bash
python undistort_rgb_image --interface usb --update_iptables
```

:::info
Use `--interface wifi` to stream over Wi-FI
:::

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img width="100%" height="100%" src={useBaseUrl('img/ARK/sdk/rgb_rectified.png')} alt="Aria Live Stream Window"/>
</div>



## Code walkthrough

### 1. Get set up
Import the SDK and connect to the Aria glasses using the Get Set Up instructions in [device_connection](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/device_connection.mdx).

### 2. Retrieve StreamingManager instance
- Get an instance of `StreamingManager` from the connected Aria glasses.

```python
streaming_manager = device.streaming_manager
```

### 3. Configure Streaming Settings (optional)
  - Set a custom configuration for streaming using the `aria.sdk.StreamingConfig` class.
  - `args.profile_name` allows you to specify the profile name for the streaming.
    _ Go to the [Sensor Profiles page](/docs/ARK/sdk/concepts/sdk_sensor_profiles) for how to retrieve details about custom profiles via CLI or SDK
  - By default, streaming uses Wi-Fi. Use the `StreamingConfig` instance to set the streaming interface to USB. Go to the [Streaming Internals page](/docs/ARK/sdk/concepts/streaming_internals.mdx) for information about the differences between Wi-Fi and USB streaming
  - Use ephemeral streaming certificates for security. This needs to be set to `true` when no persistent certificates were pre-installed. Go to the [Streaming Internals page](/docs/ARK/sdk/concepts/streaming_internals.mdx) on the various aspects of streaming security and how certificates are used.

```python
streaming_config = StreamingConfig()
streaming_config.profile_name = args.profile_name

if args.streaming_interface == "usb":
    streaming_config.streaming_interface = StreamingInterface.Usb

streaming_config.security_options.use_ephemeral_certs = True
streaming_manager.streaming_config = streaming_config
```

### 4. Access sensor calibration (optional)

Once the sensors have been configured, the recording manager can provide the sensor calibration data for those settings.

```python
sensors_calib_json = streaming_manager.sensors_calibration()
```
- A Project Aria Tools type device calibration object can then be retrieved by using the `device_calibration_from_json_string` function:
```python
from projectaria_tools.core.calibration import (
    device_calibration_from_json_string,
)
sensors_calib = device_calibration_from_json_string(sensors_calib_json)
```
To find out more about how to use sensor calibration, go to the [Accessing sensor calibration page](docs/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/calibration#accessing-sensor-calibration) and try the `undistort_rgb_image` sample app.

### 5. Start Streaming

Start streaming, using all the previously set configurations.

```python
streaming_manager.start_streaming()
```

### 6. Configure visualization settings
  - Create a visualizer using the `AriaVisualizer` class. Look at the `visualizer` file for how you can extend or define your own visualizer
  - Create a `aria.sdk.StreamingClientObserver` instance allowing you to subscribe to Aria live stream data

```python
aria_visualizer = AriaVisualizer()
aria_visualizer_streaming_client_observer = AriaVisualizerStreamingClientObserver(aria_visualizer)
```

### 6. Visualize live stream
  - Retrieve a `StreamingClient` instance from the previously retrieved `StreamingManager` instance
  - Set the `StreamingClient`'s observer instance and start subscribing to the live stream data
  - Enter the rendering loop to visualize the streaming data until the window is closed.

```python
streaming_client = streaming_manager.streaming_client
streaming_client.set_streaming_client_observer(aria_visualizer_streaming_client_observer)
streaming_client.subscribe()

aria_visualizer.render_loop()
```

### 7. Stop the stream & free resources
Once you've finished streaming:
  - Unsubscribe from `StreamingClient` instance, so that any held resources can be released
  - Stop streaming
  - Disconnect the device

```python
streaming_client.unsubscribe()
streaming_manager.stop_streaming()
device_client.disconnect(device)
```
