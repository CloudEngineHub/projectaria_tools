# Make a Recording Using the Client SDK

## Overview
This page shows how to run the code sample `device_record` to make Project Aria glasses recordings (VRS file format). It also provides a code walkthrough of its capabilities. Go to the [Glasses Quickstart Guide](/docs/ARK/ARK_quickstart#record-data) for other ways to make recordings.

`device_record` enables you to:
* Set a [recording profile](/docs/tech_spec/recording_profiles)
* Access sensor calibration through the recording manager
* Start recording, stop recording, and record for a specific duration

## Run `device_record`

### Example 1: Start and stop recording
Use the SDK to connect to the device via USB, start a 10 seconds recording using the [default recording profile](docs/ARK/ARK_quickstart#set-your-default-recording-profile), then automatically stop the recording.

1. Plug your Aria glasses into your computer, using the provided cable
2. In Terminal, go to the samples directory and run:
```
python -m device_record
```

2. The recording LED will show on your Aria glasses
3. After 10 seconds the recording will stop and be stored in your Aria glasses
   * View the recording metadata in the Recordings tab of the [Mobile Companion app](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app#recordings-menu)
   * Run `adb shell ls -l /sdcard/recording` and you should see your newly recorded file
   * Run `adb pull /sdcard/recording/myVrsFile.vrs myLocalFolder/` to download the VRS file
   * Run `adb pull /sdcard/recording/myVrsFile.json myLocalFolder/` to download the VRS metadata
   * VRS files can be visualized using the [Aria Viewer](/docs/data_utilities/visualization_guide.mdx)

### Example 2: Start and stop recording using a custom sensor profile

You can use Recording Profiles to set the sensors used when recording or streaming data. Go to [Project Aria Recording Profiles](/docs/tech_spec/recording_profiles) to find out more about the custom sensor profiles available.

This example shows mirrors the previous example, except that a specific sensor profile has been selected.

From the samples directory in Terminal, run:

```bash
python -m device_record --profile profile15
```

After 10 seconds, the recording will stop and be stored on your Aria glasses.

## Code walkthrough

### 1. Get set up
Import the Client SDK and connect to the Aria glasses using the Get Set Up instructions in [device_connection](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/device_connection.mdx).

### 2. Retrieve RecordingManager instance
   - Get an instance of `RecordingManager` from the connected device.

```python
recording_manager = device.recording_manager
```

### 3. Configure recording settings (optional)
 Use a custom configuration for your recordings
 -  `args.profile_name` allows you to specify the profile name for the recording. Go to the [Sensor Profiles page](/docs/ARK/sdk/concepts/sdk_sensor_profiles) for how to retrieve the available profiles

```python
recording_config = aria.RecordingConfig()
# If set, profile_name takes precedence over the default profile
recording_config.profile_name = args.profile_name
recording_manager.recording_config = recording_config
```

### 4. Access sensor calibration (optional)
Once the sensors have been configured, the recording manager can provide the sensor calibration data for those settings.

```python
recording_calib_json = recording_manager.sensors_calibration()
```

### 5. Start recording

```python
recording_manager.start_recording()
```

### 6. Record for specific amount of time (optional)
Set how long the Aria glasses will record before automatically turning off.

```python
time.sleep(args.recording_duration)
```

### 7. Stop Recording (optional)
To stop recording using this example:
1. Plug the glasses into your computer
2. Send the stop recording command over USB
   * The [`streaming_subscribe`](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/streaming_subscribe) code example includes how to configure your glasses to receive commands over Wi-Fi

```python
recording_manager.stop_recording()
```

:::info
You can also stop recording using the Capture button on the glasses, Mobile Companion app or CLI
:::

### 8. Disconnect
Once you've finished recording make sure you disconnect from the Aria glasses to release any held resources.

```python
device_client.disconnect(device)
```
