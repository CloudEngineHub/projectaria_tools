# Aria Research Kit Release Notes

## Aria Mobile App v115 is now available
Dear Academic Partners,
The Aria Mobile App v115 for Android is now available for download from the [Aria Web Portal](https://portal.projectaria.com) (accessed via your Android internet browser).

### NEW & UPDATED FEATURES
* Sensor data quality signals
* In-Session personalized eye gaze calibration
* Differentiate paired glasses in the pairing screen
   * When you select **Add glasses**, the available Aria devices will be split into Paired Glasses and Other Glasses so that it’s easy to tell which glasses are already paired with the app.

#### Sensor Data Quality Signals
While making recordings, researchers will be able to see whether there are any sensor data quality issues (for example, due to thermal mitigation). To check for any issues, in the Mobile Companion app, view the "Sensor Status" section in the Recording Status Screen. Tap on the row to see full details. If you’ve initiated recording via the Capture button, access the Recording Status by selecting Recording in progress on the Mobile Companion app’s main dashboard.

#### In-Session Personalized Eye Gaze Calibration
Users will be able to record personalized eye gaze calibrations within an ongoing recording. The eye gaze calibration section of the sequence can be used to improve the eye gaze estimations in the rest of the recording. In the future, Machine Perception Services will be able to consume these recordings and output more accurate gaze information.

1. In the Mobile Companion app, create a new recording using a profile that includes ET and RGB cameras (such as Profile 15 or 25)
2. Once your recording has started, close the recording window
   * Select X on the top left of the screen
4. Go to Device Settings (select the gear next to your glasses)
5. Select Eye Tracking Calibration
6. Confirm that you’d like to run the during the current recording session
7. Follow the prompts to calibrate your glasses

#### Eye Gaze Calibration tips
##### Things to Avoid
❌ Do not wear a face covering during eye calibration.

❌ Choose an area with ample and even lighting; do not face a bright light, window or reflective surface.

❌ Do not set your phone screen brightness too high compared to your surroundings.

❌ Do not fully extend your arm(s) during eye calibration. Your elbows should be bent so that the phone is roughly 1 ft (30 cm) away from your face.

##### Helpful Tips
✅ The phone should be held straight in front of your face, so that you shouldn't look up or down to see the screen. Hold the phone plumb (90 degrees) vertically to the ground.

✅ The "Leveler" stage appears if the position of your phone isn't within specifications for the calibration process. Adjust the phone in front of you and its distance by bending your elbow until the smaller, black circle turns into a green disk with a check mark.

✅ Once the "Leveler" stage is successfully completed, do your best to keep your phone in exactly the same position throughout the full eye calibration process. If your phone is moved to a position no longer suited to calibrate your device, the app will return to the "Leveler" stage.

✅ The eye calibration stages 1 to 10 move your nose towards the direction indicated by the arrow. If you're only following the direction with your gaze without moving your head, the calibration stage will time out and fail. However, you make sure to keep your eyes fixed on the number within the dot the whole time.

### BUG FIXES
