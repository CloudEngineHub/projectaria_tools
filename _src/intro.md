# Project Aria Tools

Project Aria Tools provides open tooling to support researchers expand the horizons of Augmented Reality, Machine Perception and Artificial Intelligence.

The Project Aria Tools wiki provides documentation to support research using Project Aria data or the Aria Research Kit (Aria glasses and access to cloud services).
Go to [projectaria.com](https://projectaria.com/) for an overview of the project and ways people can participate in Project Aria.

Aria data includes not only sensor data collected with Aria glasses, but also derived data generated by our Machine Perception Services (MPS). We also publish multiple open datasets captured by or simulating Aria glasses.

## Overview of sections

* [Technical Specifications](/docs/tech_spec/tech_spec.mdx): hardware specifications, the different configurations Aria glasses can use for recording and device calibration availability.

* [Data Formats](/docs/data_formats/data_formats.mdx): information about data formatting conventions used with Aria raw sensor data (stored in VRS files) as well as [Machine Perception Services (MPS) data](/docs/ARK/mps/mps.mdx).

* [Data Utilities](/docs/data_utilities/data_utilities.mdx): our opensource C++/Python library that provides access to Aria raw sensor data as well as MPS data. We also provide binaries implemented in C++ to visualize the data.
If you want to immediately dive in with the code, go to the Python [Getting Started](/docs/data_utilities/getting_started.mdx) guide for a quick tour of the library in jupyter notebook.

* [Aria Research Kit](/docs/ARK/about_ARK.mdx): how to use an Aria glasses, the companion app or request Machine Perception Services.

* [Open Datasets](/docs/open_datasets/open_datasets.mdx): [the Aria Digital Twin dataset](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/adt/) and [the Aria synthetic environments dataset](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/ase/). We provide download instructions and how to use our opensource tooling to visualize and access the data. For documentation about the [Aria Data Tools](https://facebookresearch.github.io/Aria_data_tools/docs/pilotdata/pilotdata-index/) , go to our previous wiki in Aria Data Tools. Please note, some of the file formatting will be different.

* [Tech Insights](/docs/tech_insights/tech_insights.mdx): technical deeper dives on domain-specific topics.

* [Attribution and Contributing](/docs/attribution_citation/attribution_citation.mdx): citation information.
