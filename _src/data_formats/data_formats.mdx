# Project Aria Data Formats

In this section, we describe:
* [How Aria raw data is formatted in VRS](/docs/data_formats/aria_vrs/aria_vrs_format)
* [How Machine Perception Services (MPS) data is formatted](/docs/data_formats/mps/mps_summary)
    * [MPS](/docs/ARK/mps) produces derived data that is useful for machine perception algorithms
* [2D](/docs/data_formats/coordinate_convention/2d_image_coordinate_system_convention) and [3D Coordinate System Conventions](/docs/data_formats/coordinate_convention/3d_coordinate_frame_convention)
