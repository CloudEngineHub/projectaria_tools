# ASE Data Format

This page provides an overview of Aria Synthetic Environments (ASE) data formats and organization.

Using the code snippets and tools listed in [Data Tools and Visualization](ase_data_tools), researchers should be able to quickly onboard this data into ML pipelines.

## Overall Data Organization

* Each scene has its own subdirectory with a unique ID (0-100K)
* Each scene directory contains separate files and directories for each type of data

```

## Aria RGB Sensor - Image, Depth and Instance Segmentation

For each frame from the RGB sensor we provide:
* A vignetted sensor image
* Simulated 16 bit metric depth (mm) in PNG image format
* A segmentation image (16 bit PNG)

The images in each folder are in sync. This means there will be same number of images in each folder. We also provide example data visualizers to load these images and/or associate them.

## ASE Scene Language Format

The ASE Scene Language format is set of hand-designed procedural commands in pure text form. To handle commonly encountered static indoor layout elements, we use three commands:
* `make_wall` - the full set of parameters specifies a gravity-aligned oriented box
* `make_door` - specify box-based cutouts from walls
* `make_window` - specify box-based cutouts from wall

Each command includes its own set of parameters, as described below. Given the command’s full set of parameters, a geometry is completely specified.

A single scene is described via a sequence of multiple commands. The sequence length is arbitrary and follows no specific ordering. The interpretation of the command and its arguments is carried out by a customized interpreter responsible for parsing the sequence and generating a 3D mesh of the scene.

## Trajectory and Semi-Dense Map Points

Ground-truth trajectory data provides poses for each frame generated from a simulation at 10 FPS.
We are follow the same trajectory format as [the closed loop trajectory](/docs/data_formats/mps/mps_trajectory#closed-loop-trajectory) used by [Machine Perception Services (MPS)](/docs/ARK/mps).

For semi-dense map point clouds and their observations, we follow the same [point cloud points and observations format as MPS](/docs/data_formats/mps/mps_pointcloud). The semi-dense map point cloud is generated using same algorithm as MPS, with the addition of ground-truth trajectory and simulated SLAM camera images.
