# Synthetic Environments Data Tools and Visualisation

We provide different functions and code snippets in Python to load Aria Synthetic Environments(ASE) data from a sequence and associate/interpret them with each other. The contents of each scene/sequence are detailed in **[Data Format](ase_data_format).**

They provide a set of helper functions to use the data efficiently and also visualise them. All of these snippets are placed under  **projectaria_tools/tree/main/projects/AriaSyntheticEnvironment/tutorial/code_snippets/**


## Data Helper Tools

These helper functions are broadly categorized into the following types:


* Data interpreter: `interpreter.py`
    * Provides an interpreter for the ASE Scene language file to convert them into CAD model in the form of bounding boxes
* Data readers: `readers.py`
    * Provide readers for
        * `GT trajectory`,
        * `ASE Scene language file `and
        * `Semi Dense Map points`
* Data Plotters: `plotters.py`
    * Provide simple plotting functions for
        * `CAD model generated from ASE scene language using Bounding boxes`
        * `GT Trajectory`
        * `Semi Dense Map points`



## Visualiser

We also provide Jupyter notebooks to visualise the data for each sequence and correlate them. To get started download ASE data following steps from [Dataset Download](ase_download_dataset)

## Notebook 1: Data visualiser and correlation

```
cd /path_to/projectaria_tools

jupyter notebook projects/AriaSyntheticEnvironment/tutorial/ase_tutorial_notebook.ipynb
```

### Part 1: 3D visualisation of the scene
This section will introduce the datasetâ€™s 3D components as well as code snippets to help users get familiar with them.

You will be taken through examples of how to load the 3D dataset annotations namely: GT Trajectory, ASE Scene language, and Semi Dense points; and examples of how they can be plotted.

At the end of the section you should see 3D plots containing:

* The semi-dense point cloud,
* The layout annotations, visualized as 3D box wireframes,
* The trajectory plotted as a dotted line in 3D.

### Part 2: Loading and Plotting Images and Image Annotations

Since the file structure and format are straightforward, the code consists of very simple PIL and matplotlib code to show the 3 images (RGB, depth and instance maps) side-by-side:

### Part 3: Projecting Points into Images

Running the final part of the notebook will load the camera calibration, as well as the pointcloud, trajectory and select a random frame. Then given the device pose from the trajectory, we project the points into the frame.

Points that project outside of the valid radius, should not be plotted
