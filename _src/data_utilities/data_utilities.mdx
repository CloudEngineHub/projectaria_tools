Project Aria Tools provides Python and C++ APIs. This section provides a detailed walk through of installation, visualization, code tutorials and snippets.

* [Getting started](/docs/data_utilities/getting_started)
   * A quickstart to install Project Aria Tools using a Python package followed by tutorials in Jupyter notebook. It contains:
      * Dataprovider quickstart tutorial: a walk-through of accessing sensor data from VRS file, obtaining sensor calibrations and accessing project/unproject functionalities, undistorting an image, etc.
      * Machine Perception Services (MPS) quickstart tutorial: How to visualize MPS derived data (gaze, trajectory, and point cloud)
* [Visualizers](/docs/data_utilities/visualization_guide)
   * In this tutorial we introduce binaries for visualizing Aria data
     * [Aria viewer](/docs/data_utilities/visualization_guide#ariaviewer): Visualize raw Aria data
     * [MPS Static scene visualizer](/docs/data_utilities/visualization_guide#mps-static-scene-visualizer): Visualize Aria data with trajectories, global point cloud, and static camera poses
* **Installation guide**
   * Various installation processes for Project Aria Tools API in Python and C++
   * [How to add CMake to your projects](/docs/data_utilities/installation/build_with_cmake)
   * [Install and Build Troubleshooting](/docs/data_utilities/installation/troubleshooting)
* **Core Code Snippets**
   * Python and C++ code snippets for Project Aria Tools core functionality
      * [Data Provider](docs/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/data_provider): open and load Aria raw data (VRS files)
      * [Image](/docs/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/image): Access and manage Aria images
      * [Calibration](/docs/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/calibration): Access device, 6DoF and sensor calibration
      * [MPS](/docs/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/mps): How to work with Aria derived data generated by Project Aria's Machine Perception Services
* **Advanced Code Snippets**
   * [Plotting Sensor Data (Python)](/docs/data_utilities/advanced_code_snippets/plotting_sensor_data)
       * Save images as PNG
       * Plot the raw sensor data of a VRS file and store the plots in PDF files
   * [Image Utilities (Python and C++)](/docs/data_utilities/advanced_code_snippets/image_utilities)
