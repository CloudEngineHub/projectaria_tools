In this guide, we introduce how to install the projectaria_tools python package and provide tutorials to walk through the APIs to easily access and visualize Aria data.
You will run through two jupyter notebook tutorials:

* **Dataprovider quickstart tutorial**: a walk-through of accessing sensor data from [VRS file](/docs/data_formats/aria_vrs/aria_vrs_format),
obtaining sensor calibrations and accessing project/unproject functionalities, undistorting an image, etc.
* **Machine Perception Services (MPS) quickstart tutorial**: a guide to visualize MPS data
([gaze](/docs/data_formats/mps/mps_eye_gaze), [trajectory](/docs/data_formats/mps/mps_trajectory), and [point cloud](/docs/data_formats/mps/mps_pointcloud)), etc.

[**Jupyter notebook error**](/docs/data_utilities/installation/troubleshooting#jupyter-notebook-error) : If you have problems using Jupyter examples, please [upgrade python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to the latest version.

## Step 0 : Check system requirements and download codebase

[Ensure your system is supported and then download projectaria_tools codebase from the github](/docs/data_utilities/installation/download_codebase)

## Step 1 : Install Python

Ensure python3 is installed on the system (check with `python3 --version)`

## Step 2 : Create a virtual environment

```bash
rm -rf $HOME/projectaria_tools_python_env

python3 -m venv $HOME/projectaria_tools_python_env

source $HOME/projectaria_tools_python_env/bin/activate
```

## Step 3 : Install projectaria_tools from pypi

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip

pip3 install projectaria-tools'[all]'
```

## Step 4: Run Dataprovider quickstart tutorial

```bash
cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox

jupyter notebook projectaria_tools/core/examples/dataprovider_quickstart_tutorial.ipynb
```

## Step 5: Run Machine Perception Services (MPS) quickstart tutorial
In the MPS tutorial, the notebook walks through how to visualize gaze, trajectory, and point cloud from MPS data.
```bash
cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox

jupyter notebook projectaria_tools/core/examples/mps_quickstart_tutorial.ipynb
```
