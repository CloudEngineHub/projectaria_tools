# Visualizers

This page introduces the core visualization tools available in Project Aria Tools. We've provided example datasets to test these tools.


* [Aria Viewer](#aria-viewer): visualize raw Aria data
* [MPS 3D Scene Viewer](#mps-static-scene-visualizer):  renders a static scene using Aria data with trajectories,
global point cloud, and static camera poses
* [MPS Eye Gaze Viewer](#mps-eye-gaze-visualizer): visualize Aria data with eye gaze data
---

## Requirements

### Step 0 : Check system requirements and download codebase

Go to the [Download Codebase](/docs/data_utilities/installation/download_codebase) page to:
   * Check your system is supported
   * Download projectaria_tools codebase from the github

### Step 1 : Build and install visualizers

The visualizers need the C++ version of Project Aria Tools to run.

* In the [C++ Installation Guide](/docs/data_utilities/installation/installation_cpp), follow the instructions to [build from source with visualization](docs/data_utilities/installation/installation_cpp#build-from-source-with-visualization)

## Run Aria Viewer

[Aria Viewer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/main/tools/visualization/main.cpp) enable you to to visualize Aria device recorded VRS files. It shows all sensor data including:
* Camera images
* IMU
* Audio (visualization of waveform, sound is not available)

```bash
cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox/build

./tools/visualization/aria_viewer --vrs ../projectaria_tools/data/mps_sample/sample.vrs
```

## Run MPS 3D Scene Viewer

The [MPS 3D Scene Viewer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/main/tools/mps_visualization/main_3d_scene_viewer.cpp) renders a static scene using location MPS output.

Through this tool you can create visualizations using:
* Closed loop trajectories
* Global point cloud
* Static camera poses
* Open loop trajectories
   * Because open loop is in odometry frame of reference, it shouldnâ€™t be visualized with closed loop trajectories, global points or static camera poses

This tutorial generates a visualization containing:
* Closed loop trajectories
* Global point cloud

```bash
cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox/build

./tools/mps_visualization/mps_3d_scene_viewer \
    --closed-loop-traj \
    ../projectaria_tools/data/mps_sample/trajectory/closed_loop_trajectory.csv \
    --global-point-cloud \
    ../projectaria_tools/data/mps_sample/trajectory/global_points.csv.gz
```

:::info
Because the sample dataset doesn't have static cameras you won't be able to interact with the static camera settings

## MPS Eye Gaze visualizer

The [MPS Eye Gaze visualizer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/main/tools/mps_visualization/main_eyegaze.cpp) renders the computed eye gaze and vrs data side by side. The visualizer contains:

* Eye Tracking camera stream
* RGB, Mono Scene (SLAM) left and right camera streams
   * A red dot shows the projection of the eye gaze onto the image
   * The projection is computed using a fixed depth of 1m
* 2D graph plot of the gaze yaw and pitch angles in radians
* 2D radar plot of the eye gaze yaw and pitch angles

```bash
cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox/build

./tools/mps_visualization/mps_eyegaze_viewer \
    --vrs ../projectaria_tools/data/mps_sample/sample.vrs \
    --eyegaze  ../projectaria_tools/data/mps_sample/eye_gaze/eyegaze.csv
```
