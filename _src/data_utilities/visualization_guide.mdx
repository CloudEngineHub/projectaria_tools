# Visualizers
In this section, we introduce all the core visualization tools available in Project Aria Tools. Example datasets are also provided to test those tools.

* [Aria viewer](#ariaviewer): visualize Aria data
* [MPS Static scene visualizer](#mps-static-scene-visualizer): visualize Aria data with trajectories,
global point cloud, and static camera poses
* [MPS eye gaze viewer](#mps-eye-gaze-visualizer): visualize Aria data with eye gaze data

## Step 0 : Check system requirements and download codebase

[Ensure your system is supported and then download projectaria_tools codebase from the github](/docs/data_utilities/installation/download_codebase.mdx)

## Step 1 : Build and install visualizers

Follow the [entire C++ installation](/docs/data_utilities/installation/installation_cpp) to build projectaria_tools C++ libraries with visualization.

## Step 2 : Run AriaViewer
[AriaViewer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/main/tools/visualization/main.cpp) is used to visualize Aria device recorded VRS files, which shows all sensor data including camera images,
imu, audio, etc. (No sound will be available.)

```bash
cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox/build

./tools/visualization/aria_viewer --vrs ../projectaria_tools/data/mps_sample/sample.vrs
```

## Step 3 : Run MPS Static Scene Visualizer

The [MPS 3D scene Viewer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/main/tools/mps_visualization/main_3d_scene_viewer.cpp) is a renders the location MPS output. It consists of

1. Open/Closed loop trajectories
2. Global Point cloud
3. Static camera poses

Since open loop trajectory is in odometry frame of reference, it shouldnâ€™t be used together with closed loop trajectories, global points or static camera poses
```bash
cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox/build

./tools/mps_visualization/mps_3d_scene_viewer \
    --closed-loop-traj \
    ../projectaria_tools/data/mps_sample/trajectory/closed_loop_trajectory.csv \
    --global-point-cloud \
    ../projectaria_tools/data/mps_sample/trajectory/global_points.csv.gz
```

Note that this sample dataset has no static cameras, therefore those buttons will not change anything in this example.

## Step 4: MPS Eye Gaze visualizer

The [MPS Eye Gaze visualizer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/main/tools/mps_visualization/main_eyegaze.cpp) renders the computed eye gaze and vrs data side by side. It consists of

1. Eye camera stream
2. RGB, SLAM left and SLAM right camera streams with a red dot showing the projection of the eye gaze onto the image. **The projection is computed using a fixed depth of 1m.**
3. 2D graph plot of the gaze yaw and pitch angles in radians.
4. 2D radar plot of the eye gaze yaw and pitch angles.

```bash
cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox/build

./tools/mps_visualization/mps_eyegaze_viewer \
    --vrs ../projectaria_tools/data/mps_sample/sample.vrs \
    --eyegaze  ../projectaria_tools/data/mps_sample/eye_gaze/eyegaze.csv
```
