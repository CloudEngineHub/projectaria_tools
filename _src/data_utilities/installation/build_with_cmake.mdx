To use projectaria_tools for your own projects with CMake, we recommend adding it as a submodule in your project using:

```bash
cd /path_to_your_project

git submodule add https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools.git
```

Then, in your project root CMakeLists.txt, add the subdirectory using:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(projectaria_tools)
```
You can then link your project targets (libraries or executables) to projectaria_tools modules.
For example, to link with the sensor_calibration library, use:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(my_target
  PUBLIC
    sensor_calibration
)
```

#### Example code
Please refer to the [sample project](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/tree/main/sample_project) for a full example.

NOTE: install targets are coming soon so that you can install projectaria_tools and access it using find_package() in your CMakeLists.txt
