title: IMU Noise Model
---

In our visual-inertial fusion algorithm, we model, as traditionally done, the stochastic part of the IMU error as including three components:

The noise along any of the axis of the inertial sensor is written described as the sum of those contributions:
$$
 x^{\text{sampled}}_k = x^{\text{true}}_k + n^{\text{turn-on bias}}_{k0} + n^{\text{bias random walk}}_k + n^{\text{white noise}}_k
$$
Where $x^{\text{true}}_k$ is the real value of the quantity measured projected on the sensor sensitive axis. $x^{\text{sampled}}_k$ is the sampled value seen as a random variable. $n^{\text{turn-on bias}}_{k0}$ is a random variable draw from a Gaussian when the device is turned-on (denoted here as step $k_0$). $n^{\text{white noise}}_{k}$ is the time-independent noise components and draw from a 0-centered Gaussian at each step $k$. The latter noise is sometime \emph{Angle Random walk in $rad/s/\sqrt{Hz}$} for the gyrometer and the \emph{Velocity Random Walk in $m/s/\sqrt{Hz}$} for the accelerometer. The covariance of the Gaussian is usually characterized by the continuous noise $\sigma_c$ strength (in the same unit), which needs to be multiplied by the sampling period $\Delta t$ to get the distribution of the sample noise: $\sigma^2_c \Delta t$. Finally, $n^{\text{bias random walk}}_k$ is draw from a random walk process.

The parameter describing those noises are derived from an Allan Variance plot computed from data collected over a period of 24 hours in a temperature stable environment. See Table below for the white noise and bias instability parameters of Aria IMU sensors.

||accel-left | accel-right| gyro-left | gyro-right|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|white noise|$0.9\times 10^-6$|$0.8\times 10^-6$|$5\times 10^-3$|$10^-2$|
|bias instability|$280\times 10^-6$|$350\times 10^-6$|$1.3\times 10^-3$|$0.6^-3$|

Also see the following Figure for the Allan Variance plot supporting this measurement, note that the data duration used for Allan Variance was not enough to capture the bias random walk confidently. In practice, we tune the parameter of the bias random walk used for sensor-fusion starting from the bias instability measured on the Allan Variance of the sensor (the floor of the curve) and inflating it by a tuning factor. This is because real MEMS sensors are not that well modelled by this stochastic model.
