title: Sensor Measurement Model

For IMUs, we employ an affine model where the value from the readout of accelerometer $s_a$ or gyroscope $s_g$, is compensated to obtain a "real" acceleration $a$ and angular velocity $\omega$ by
$$
a = M_a s_a + b_a \qquad
\omega = M_g s_g + b_g
$$
$M_a$ and $M_g$ are assumed to be upper triangular so that there is no global rotation from the imu body frame to the accelerometer frame.

Inversely, we can simulate the sensor read-out from acceleration or angular velocity by
$$
a = M_a^{-1} (s_a - b_a) \qquad
\omega = M_g^{-1} (s_g - b_g)
$$

When the read-out signal exceeds a threshold, the signal saturates. Saturation limits are sensor dependent and referenced in the following table for accelerometer and gyrometers.

||accel-left | accel-right| gyro-left | gyro-right|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|saturation|4g|8g|5000|1000|

Similar to the IMU rectification model, the sensor readout of magnetometer, barometer, and audio data are modeled as linear to the real $r$ (magnetic field, air pressure and sound intensity). Audio specifically is bias only.
